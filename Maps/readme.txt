This file will be descriptions/backstories of all the maps here, likely in order of creation.

"hexsector" - MAPS1 (incomplete)
	A broken port of my friend Poly's old SRB2 Match map "Hexagonal Sector". Objects don't show up, probably because I didn't assign any skill levels to them when converting from SRB2.
Might complete this at a later date.

"Warehouse.wad" - MAP01, MAP02 (incomplete)
	A map I mostly created on my own, but with some assistance near the end by Skull, who now has a game of his own called "On Your Hands". It's on Steam.
Includes FAR too many Realm667 assets, and a VGM rip of Gravity Beetle's theme from Mega Man X3, probably from Zophar's Domain.
MAP02 is incomplete, but has a pretty neat layered skybox. Crystals are from Sonic 1's Labyrinth Zone, music is from Yoshi's Island, and the rock texture is from SRB2 2.1.

"PowerPlant.wad" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	Another attempt at a map using way too many R667 assets.
Has a Cyber Imp, more keycards, a plasma shotgun that kinda sucks, and a single Arachnotron, who was probably meant to be replaced by a ceiling turret.

"water" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	An attempt at using *fewer* R667 assets.
Has zombies that shoot projectiles so you can swim to dodge them, cool elevators and stacked 3D floors, Liquid Texture Pack v5.1, and an awesome MIDI of Splash Woman's stage theme.
Load MAP01.wad and WaterMap.pk3, or else you won't get the map itself.

"training" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	Okay, so, I wanted to make a map like SRB2 2.2's Tutorial map, but as a Doom map... and then I remembered I'm kinda bad at mapping. That's it, really.
Originally, it was going to use Super Smash Bros. Melee's "Break the Targets" music, but I quit before I even added it.

"techbase" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	I watched Civvie11's video on Chasm: The Rift, got inspired to make a cool map with a pump double barrel shotgun, and then quit after I made the outside area. I should recycle this...

"snow" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	An attempt at making a snowy map. Uses a MIDI of Ristar's "Ring Rink" (Planet Freon, stage 5-1).
Was originally going to be vanilla-compatible, but I found the snow/ice/rock textures to have converted very poorly.
I wanted to use R667's Impactor Gauntlet, so I did. I wanted to use it to have the player fly over gaps... I made a little area for that idea, then did nothing with it.
I had also recently played You Dig, a map made up almost entirely of "breakable" (shoot to instantly lower) walls, so I copied that idea, intending the player to use the dash mechanic of the Impactor Gauntlet to smash the wall.
I like destructible geometry.
Has a troll face behind spawn that was meant to only be visible with lite-amp goggles.
Other textures from Super Mario 64 DS...?
Includes a prototype version of the Ice Shotgun that would later be used in my own weapon mod (https://github.com/GeminiCrafterMan/gem-doomweps).

"snow/MAP01.wad" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	A continuation of the last map, for some reason. The vision had changed since the last version. Originally had an axe where the chainsaw is, which is still in the files. "give axe".

"stankymap" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	My first *real* attempt at a vanilla-compatible map. It's actually vanilla-compatible! No UDMF, no Boom, no Decorate, no DeHackEd, just vanilla.
I'd say it went pretty okay, and I really like the FIREBLU behind the bars and the trim on the bottom of the walls.
Music is the unused "un23.mid", a MIDI cover of "Sex Type Thing" by Stone Temple Pilots by Bobby Prince.

"stankymap2" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	A not-so-vanilla attempt to continue the vanilla map. Ported to UDMF, used to abuse shiny floors. Run with CageTex, which is not included, but is used in "water".
Somehow, even with CageTex included, is missing the door texture for the shootable switch room.

"snow2" - MAP01 (incomplete)
	My first attempt at using OTEX. Music is "Icescape" by ProjectFM for the Sonic 1 ROM hack "Sonic the Hedgehog: Isle of Magnetic Artifacts", abbreviated as "SHIMA" ("ISLAND" in English... Funny Japanese influence).
Did not get very far.
